# This scripts executes fastQC, extracts relevant information from the output 
# (that is the html file and the textual summary stored in the zip archive) and
# removes the temporary files (that is, the zip archive).
# It requires three parameters, namely:
# $1, the fastq file to assess (e.g., mysample.fq.gz)
# $2, the label used to rename the summary files (e.g., "mysample")
# $3, the number of threads
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


#This has been added to deal with the Docker image (fastQC requires X11 to be set)
